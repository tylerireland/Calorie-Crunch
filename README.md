# Calorie-Crunch

## Description

Calorie Crunch is an digital journal for tracking calories and excercise. It creates a file to save users and their data. When the program starts it prompts for a new or returning user. If returning it will search through the file for the correct user inputted. If no user is found it will create a new user. Basic information is inputted for the user and their basal metabolic rate (BMR) is calculated from those stats. Your BMR is the total calories you burn everyday when performing basic life-sustaining functions. You are then able to add any food consumed and any excercises performed. The program will calculate total calories burned based the on the total time and intensity of the workout. Everything is recorded into the file and once the user logs off, everything on that file is saved.
